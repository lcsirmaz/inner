* Iterations of the double description algorithm

* int init_dd(int dim, double v[0:dim-1])
*    initialize the DD algorithm, supplying the very first vertex.
*    The algorithms is tailored to MOLP minimization; the positive
*    endpoints of coordinate axes (the *ideal* vertices) are assumed
*    to be feasible solutions. Arguments:
*      dim:         the dimension of the space.
*      v[0:dim-1]:  coordinates of the very first extremal solution.
*    Return value:
*     0:  initialization is successful
*     1:  either the dimension is too large, or out of memory.
*
* int get_next_facet(int from)
*    Get the index of a facet of the actual approximation which is
*    not marked as facet of the final polytope. When 'from' is non-
*    negative, return only facets which have index >= from. If
*    from==-1, then return the smallest index, or a random index
*    depending on the parameter RandomFacet. Return -1 if no facet
*    is found.
*    
* void mark_facet_as_final(fno)
*    Mark facet with index fno as facet of the final polytope.
*
* void get_facet_into(int fno, double eq[0:dim])
*    Retrieve the equation of the facet with index fno. In the
*    internal representation all coefficients in eq[0:dim-1] are
*    non-negative and sum to 1.0. When returning the equation it
*    is scaled and after scaling values closer to and integer than
*    ScaleEps are rounded up to that integer.
*
* void add_new_vertex(double v[0:dim-1])
*    Specify the vertex which enlarges the inner approximation. When
*    the routine returns, check error conditions in dd_stats.
